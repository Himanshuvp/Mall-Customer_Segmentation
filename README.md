# Mall-Customer_Segmentation

This is the machine learning project in which cluster analysis has performed on the dataset of mall custmours. The method used in this project is k-means algorithm. The clustering is done according to their annual income and spending score in mall. The k-means method uses aritmetic distancee between a particular datapoint and pre-fixed centroid. First, the data preprocessing is done in which the statistical measures are calculated. Also checked missiong values and did some plotting under exploratory  data analysis. Elbow method is used to find the appropriate number of clusters to be used in this model. The model developed and clusters are made that can we innterpreted usin a visualizaation.
